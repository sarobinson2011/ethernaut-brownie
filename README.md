# Ethernaut Level Solutions (using Brownie)

### Levels split into individual folders, under contracts...


- 03-Coin Flip
        -->     SOLVED
        
        Solution lies in the fact that a blockchain is a deterministic data structure, and as such there is no way of generating a random number with sufficient entropy, that cannot be gamed.
        So, we simply copy and paste the code that creates the "random result" into an attack contract.
        Run this (which happens concurrently with the original contract - it's a blockchain remember!), with a require "correct result" statement.
        Then we simply keep flipping the coin until we have 10 wins.

- 04-Telephone
        -->     SOLVED

        Solution creates an instance of the Attack04 contract.
        Passes the Telephone contract to it's Constructor.
        When you then call attack on the Attack04 contract, it triggers changeOwner().
        This shows how you use a proxy contract to attack a deployed contract.

- 05-Token
        -->     SOLVED

        Solution sets up an interface, in order to interact with the Token contract.
        Then calls transfer to a random address, for 21 tokens. 
        This causes the 0.6.0 solidity code to underflow a uint256.  
        Balance then gets sent to msg.sender (in the original contract).

- 06-Delegation
        -->     SOLVED

        Solution uses the transfer method to interact with contract Delegate.
        The data passed to Delegate is the 'function selector' for the pwn() function.
        This is the first 5 bytes from keccak256 hash of "pwn()".
        Fallback is called, which uses delegatecall to effectively call the pwn() function.
        Thus ownership is transferred to 'msg.sender' from 'Delegation'.

- 07-Force
        -->     SOLVED

        Solution uses the selfdestruct in-built function to 'force transfer' funds over.
        A proxy contract Attack07 is deployed with a payable constructor && the receive function.
        Attack07 can be loaded with funds using either the constructor or receive method.
        The function 'attack' calls selfdestruct, with the Force contract address an argument.
        Selfdestruct force-sends all funds in the contract to the Force contract address.
        Attack07 then destroys itself, as per the selfdestruct() functionality.
                
- 08-Vault
        -->     SOLVED  

        Solution exploits the inability of deterministic blockchains to store security sensitive date, such as passwords.
        Password is easily obtained via:

        - password = web3.eth.get_storage_at(ETHERNAUT_INSTANCE, 1).
        
        - Where ETHERNAUT_INSTANCE is the contract address
        - '1' is the memory storage slot - run this with 0, 1, 2 see what happens ;-0
        
        Then simply use the vault interface to interact and call unlock(password) to win.

- 09-King
        -->
                SOLVED

        Solution exploits the fact it is not possible to 'catch a revert' that occurs in an *external* contract when using the transfer() function.
        When the transfer function encounters a revert in the recipient contract, it also reverts the entire transaction that called it, including the receive() function.
        Assumption is that the developers assumed all "players" would be EOAs.
        Soultion is to use the call() function, which does have the ability to handle reverts and errors.
        See "transaction diagram" (check naming convention) for more details.

- 10-Re-entrancy
        -->
                SOLVED

        Solution is simple to describe, but proved a little more tricky to implement in practice.
        Fully working Solidity and Brownie (Python) code is publicly available in GitHub repo.

        The security flaw in the lies in the withdraw(uint _amount) function, that transfers funds BEFORE subtracting the transfer from the account balance. 
        After checking that the account has funds to withdraw, a low-level call  is made to msg.sender, to transfer the funds.
        
        I guess the code was written assuming calls from EOAs, but if the call is made from a proxy contract we can then include a receive() function, receive() then simply calls withdraw(uint _amount) again. In this way we can reduce the balance to zero before 'balances[msg.sender] -= _amount' gets executed.
        
        This level was designed to explain the re-entrancy attack that famously drained the Ethereum DAO, otherwise known colloquially as "The DAO Hack".

        The official Solidity Language docs (link below) advise to use the standard 'Checks-Effects-Interactions' pattern when writing solidity functions, as follows:

        1. First perform checks e.g. who called the function, did they send enough eth etc.
        2. Second perform updates to state variables 
        3. Third (and last) execute any interactions with other contracts (known or unknown)

- 11-Elevator
        -->
                SOLVED

        This problem was a little tricky to wrap my head around, until the penny finally dropped.
        In order to solve this level all you need to do is set the state variable top == true.
        The vulnerability in the code occurs in the function isLastFloor(uint), this function has
        a visibility modifer external, and no modifier to limit ability to alter state variables.
        Hence we can attack Elevator by writing malicious functionality into the isLastFloor()
        function in our Attack11 contract.
        The goTo(uint _floor) function makes a conditional check on the negated boolean return
        value from isLastFloor(). Thus by returning a negated bool from Attack11 we can force 
        top to equal true.
        To mitigate this vulnerability, the isLastFloor() function should have the 'view' function
        modifier.  This removes the ability to change state variables, thus you cannot win.

- 12-Privacy
        -->
                SOLVED

        The solution to this level lies in the fact that data is **never** actually 'private' on-chain.
        The challenge is simple - call unlock(_key) where the _key argument needs to equal the first
        16 bytes of the bytes32[2] state variable 'data'. Data has the visibility specifier 'private'.
        However, by using the web3.eth.get_storage_at() function, passing in the contract address, 
        and the specific slot you want to view, the function returns the hex data stored at that slot. 
        
        - Note: storage slot numbering starts at index 0.
        
        There are 6 state variables (2 uint8 in a row - which could be packed together) so the data
        variable will most likely be stored at slot 4 (if uint8's are packed) or slot 5 (if not packed).
        I first printed all 6 slots to the console, and by looking at the bytes returned it was obvious that the 2 uint8 variables are not packed together. So the data variable is stored at slot 5.
        From there I simply slice the data array and pass the first 16 bytes as the key to unlock().
        
        Et voilÃ ... contract successfully unlocked.

        Lesson learned: private variables are only private for the smart contract scope, meaning they can't be accessed or modified from other smart contracts. However, their values **can** be read freely outside the blockchain, by anyone, so they don't actually 'hide' data in that sense.
